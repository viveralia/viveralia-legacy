This is an updated version of my portfolio designed and developed by me, IvÃ¡n. You can take a look at the live version [here](https://viveralia.mx).

## Design

The design is strongly based on minimal and simple forms, focusing on the projects exposure with colorful mockups. All the high-res wireframes were done using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

## Development

The portfolio was made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a blazing fast ðŸ”¥ static site generator for [React](https://reactjs.org/), querying data from markdown files with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), styling the site with CSS in JS using [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and deploying it with [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) continuous deployment feature, to keep things simple, yet scalable. And it even is a PWA for you to download and enjoy!
